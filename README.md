# Project Deep Learning: Traffic Sign Recognition

**Main branch** is the stable version. Make changes in the **develop branch**. You can request a pull/merge to the main branch once significant improvements are made.

German traffic sign benchmark dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign/data) and clicking download. Upload the zip file to your google drive (I chose path German-traffic-signs/archive.zip) (so if you change location change corresponding line in python). 

## Stable and Development Versions
- **Stable Version:** The stable version of the project is in the **main branch**.
- **Development Version:** The latest changes and experimental features can be found in the **develop branch**. Make commits here and merge into the main branch when ready.

Access the project notebook (stable version) on Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13d3OxR17lEpdMIqDzQYMeGqTh-vXQh71?usp=sharing). This link is necessary as the repository is private.

## To-do list
- Read project proposal (make changes) https://www.overleaf.com/read/tyhkqpgddgjs#f537bc
- Set up a baseline CNN model and train for a few epochs
- Modify and ...
- Maybe do data augmentation (does it make sense to rotate traffic signs?)?
- Set up a bayesian CNN. For example Bayes by Backprop. See for example here for code example for Bayes by Backprop: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Enhancing-Deep-Learning-with-Bayesian-Inference/tree/main/ch05/bbb

- Check robustness on data. Modify data

## Contribution Guidelines
- Make changes in the **develop branch**.
- Open a pull request for significant improvements to be reviewed before merging into the main branch.
- Ensure that all changes are properly documented.
