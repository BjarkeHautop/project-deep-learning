German traffic sign benchmark dataset can be downloaded by clicking [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign/data) and clicking download. Upload the zip file to your google drive (I chose path German-traffic-signs/archive.zip) (so if you change location change corresponding line in python).
