# Project Deep Learning: Traffic Sign Recognition

This project was made in collaboration with [Christina Grand](https://github.com/Christinagrand) and [Laura Fur](https://github.com/lauramhfur) in our course Deep Learning for Visual Recognition. Our project can be read here (insert link ...). 

To run the notebook download the dataset German traffic sign benchmark dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign/data). Upload the zip file to your google drive. I chose path German-traffic-signs/archive.zip, so if you change location change corresponding line in python. 

Access the project notebook on Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13sinqL_gKc4Pjr3Vthyoy9Oz-zUtiEKY?usp=sharing). The images we used for out-of-dist images can be found [here](https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/project-deep-learning/tree/main/out-of-dist-images).

Our more detailed steps where we tried many different models and ideas to build our CNN can be found in this notebook: [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mkO0da_xT6EvOzx3tu7WttY9SrB04cR4?usp=sharing) 

Our project report is on Overleaf. It can be viewed and edited [here](https://www.overleaf.com/7537817147pnfzkmddskrb#ffc558).
