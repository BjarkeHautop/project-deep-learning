# Project-deep-learning
German traffic sign benchmark dataset can be downloaded by clicking [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign/data) and clicking download. Upload the zip file to your google drive (I chose path German-traffic-signs/archive.zip) (so if you change location change corresponding line in python). 

The link to the google colab is https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13d3OxR17lEpdMIqDzQYMeGqTh-vXQh71?usp=sharing (needed to share colab link since repo is private).
