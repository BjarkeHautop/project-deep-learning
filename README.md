# Project-deep-learning
German traffic sign benchmark dataset can be downloaded by clicking [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign/data) and clicking download. Upload the zip file to your google drive (I chose path German-traffic-signs/archive.zip) (so if you change location change corresponding line in python). 

**This is the stable version of the link. For the newest link (or ipynb file) go to develop branch and make commits to develop branch**

The link to the google colab is https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13d3OxR17lEpdMIqDzQYMeGqTh-vXQh71?usp=sharing (needed to share colab link since repo is private).

## To-do list

- Read project proposal (make changes) https://www.overleaf.com/read/tyhkqpgddgjs#f537bc
  
- Set up a baseline CNN model and train for a few epochs

- Modify and ...

- Maybe do data augmentation (does it make sense to rotate traffic signs?)?

- Set up a bayesian CNN. For example Bayes by Backprop. See for example here for code example for Bayes by Backprop: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Enhancing-Deep-Learning-with-Bayesian-Inference/tree/main/ch05/bbb

- Check robustness on data. Modify data
