# Project Deep Learning: Quantifying Uncertainty in Traffic Sign Recognition

This project was made in collaboration with [Christina Grand](https://github.com/Christinagrand) and [Laura Fur](https://github.com/lauramhfur) in our course Deep Learning for Visual Recognition. Our project can be read [here](https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/project-deep-learning/blob/main/Project_deep_learning.pdf). In this project, we explored different ways to quantify uncertainty for deep learning models such as MC dropout and Bayesian Neural Networks. 

# Code
Our main .ipynb file where the code for the project is done is at [Project_DL.ipynb](https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/project-deep-learning/blob/main/Project_DL.ipynb). 

We also have another .ipynb where we for example did some experiments on our CNN model is at [Project_Step_by_step_and_gradCAM.ipynb](https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/project-deep-learning/blob/main/Project_Step_by_step_and_gradCAM.ipynb).

## Running the code
To run the notebook download the dataset German traffic sign benchmark dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign/data). Upload the zip file to your Google Drive. I chose the path German-traffic-signs/archive.zip, so if you change the location change the corresponding line in Python. The images we used for out-of-dist images can be found [here](https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/project-deep-learning/tree/main/out-of-dist-images).
