# Project Deep Learning: Quantifying Uncertainty in Traffic Sign Recognition

This project was made in collaboration with [Christina Grand](https://github.com/Christinagrand) and [Laura Fur](https://github.com/lauramhfur) in our course Deep Learning for Visual Recognition. Our project can be read [here](https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/project-deep-learning/blob/main/Project_deep_learning.pdf). In this project, we explored different ways to quantify uncertainty for deep learning models such as MC dropout and Bayesian Neural Networks. 

To run the notebook download the dataset German traffic sign benchmark dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign/data). Upload the zip file to your Google Drive. I chose the path German-traffic-signs/archive.zip, so if you change the location change the corresponding line in Python. The images we used for out-of-dist images can be found [here](https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/project-deep-learning/tree/main/out-of-dist-images).
